Requirements:

1 - Your API must be written using Java 8 or newer, ECMAscript 2015 or newer, or C# 8.0;

  aswer => Done in Java 11 on OpenJDK 14.

2 - Data must be retrieved from Github website by using web scraping techniques. Do not use Github’s API;

  aswer => OK, it doesn't use any GIT API;

3 - Do not use web scraping libraries. We would like to know your ideas on how it can be done;

  aswer => OK, it doesn't use any king of scraping libraries;

4 - Your API must support thousands of concurrent requests;

  aswer => Good question !? I proposed to serial mode (with no Threads / Tasks). The parallelism would be done in the "thousands of concurrent requests", i.e., my api does a serialized  process (step-by-step).
           But, the @Async was used on "largeAPI" ( pool for 1.000 requests)  

5 - We think it’s ok if the first request to a particular repository takes some time to respond (since you depend on Github website response times), but we don’t expect the subsequent requests to be long;

  aswer => Thinking about it, I DID a simple cache (4 hours => expiration time) for the same URL/Git REPO.

6 - We don’t expect to get timeout errors;

  aswer => Well, there is no miracle, there are two APIs, one synchronous for small repositories and another for large repositories with a parameter for calling a webhook when process is complete. 

7 - We must understand your code and use your API without having to ask you any questions. Our primary language is English so please use it on comments and documentation;

  aswer => Ok :) 

8 - We’d like to see SOLID principles in your solution;

  aswer => I wish too (I am trying). 
 
9 - You are free to choose your API contracts (parameters and response formats) but we’d like to be able to integrate it with any other existing solutions;

  aswer => It is a simple REST API, so you can use the JASON (result) for your another existing solutions;  

10 - You don’t need to persist any data (but feel free to do it if you want);

  aswer => Ok. I only use memory (for cache). 

11 -  We’d like to see at least one automated test;

  aswer => Ok. JUNIT for Controller methods.   

12 - You must deploy your solution to a cloud provider like Amazon AWS or Heroku and send us the link to access it. It’s a plus if you publish a Docker image with your application (including its dependencies) in a registry like Docker Hub and let us know how to get it.

  aswer => Published at Heroku ( https://intense-eyrie-64452.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui/#/api-controller ) 
         Ex: ==> https://intense-eyrie-64452.herokuapp.com/countgitsmallrepo?URLGITRepository=https://github.com/trmjava/z_web_scraping

13 -  Push your source code to a Github or Bitbucket repository and send the link to jobs-br@trustly.com.
